repo to my card: https://github.com/nyuzui/my-card.git

## 5 similarities between the open-wc repo structure and your react / vue / angular structures?

Component-Based Approach: They all use components as the building blocks of their applications.
Folder Organization: They have similar folder structures to keep code organized.
Separation of Concerns: They separate code into HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for clarity.
Build Tools: Modern build tools are used to process and optimize code.
Testing and Documentation: They emphasize testing and documentation alongside the code.

## Was this easier, harder, or the same difficulty as exploring the frameworks?
it was a lot easier to explore compared to the rest, it seemed like the rest had more complex structures when it came to creating things.
## Any concept, structure, terminology, etc that you're struggling with and need additional guidance at the end of this homework / 1st 5 weeks (1/3 of course)?
im struggling with terminal terminology, npm and such things are a little bit confusing.
